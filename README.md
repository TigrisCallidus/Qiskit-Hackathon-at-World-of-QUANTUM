### About

The Qiskit Hackathon@World of QUANTUM is the first Qiskit event happening in person in Germany hosted by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), IBM Quantum's Community Team and Messe MÃ¼nchen GmbH.

The hackathon will kickoff with an opening presentation and guideline review.

Participants will then form teams of 4-5 people and work on a challenge for the next 24 hours.
